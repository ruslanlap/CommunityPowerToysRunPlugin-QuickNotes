### üîç Major Changes

  - More robust handling of note searching and identification prevents accidental deletions or modifications

- **Improved Error Handling**:
  - Enhanced error messages provide clearer information when operations fail
  - Better file access handling to prevent data loss
  - More consistent backup behavior to protect your notes

- **Enhanced UI Messages**:
  - Better user feedback when operations succeed or fail
  - Clearer instructions for recovering from errors
  - More descriptive tooltips for note details

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Improvements

- **Code Architecture**:
  - Removed dependency on file position (FileLineIndex) for note identification
  - Implemented content-based identification for all note operations
  - Enhanced search algorithms to find the correct note even if the file structure changes

- **Reliability**:
  - More robust checks before performing operations on notes
  - Better validation of note content during operations
  - Improved compatibility with external file changes

## üêõ Bug Fixes

- **Critical**: Fixed issue where notes could be deleted incorrectly when targeting by index
- **Critical**: Fixed problem where editing a note could overwrite the wrong note if the file structure changed
